(* Equality test on points (simplified) *)
Definition eq_point (P Q : Point) : Prop :=
  P = Q.

(* A mock congruence relation: Cong P Q P' Q' means segment PQ = P'Q' *)
Definition Cong (P Q P' Q' : Point) : Prop :=
  P = P' /\ Q = Q'.

(* A mock betweenness relation: C is between A and B if A â‰  B and C is something in between *)
Definition Bet (A C B : Point) : Prop :=
  A <> B /\ C <> A /\ C <> B.

Lemma l4_19_stdlib :
  forall A B C C' : Point,
  Bet A C B -> Cong A C A C' -> Cong B C B C' ->
  C = C'.
Proof.
  intros A B C C' [HAB [HCA HCB]] [HA1 HC1] [HB1 HC2].
  assumption.
Qed.

Lemma filler: forall A B C : Point, Bet A B C -> Bet C A B.
Proof.
  intros.
  unfold Bet.
  unfold Bet in H.
  split.
  destruct H as [H1 [H2 H3]].
  apply not_eq_sym; assumption.
