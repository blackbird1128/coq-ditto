Inductive Point : Type :=
  | point : nat ->  Point.

(* Equality test on points (simplified) *)
Definition eq_point (P Q : Point) : Prop :=
  P = Q.

(* A mock congruence relation: Cong P Q P' Q' means segment PQ = P'Q' *)
Definition Cong (P Q P' Q' : Point) : Prop :=
  P = P' /\ Q = Q'.

(* A mock betweenness relation: C is between A and B if A â‰  B and C is something in between *)
Definition Bet (A C B : Point) : Prop :=
  A <> B /\ C <> A /\ C <> B.

Lemma l4_19_stdlib : forall A B C C' : Point,
  Bet A C B ->
  Cong A C A C' ->
  Cong B C B C' ->
  C = C'.
Proof.
  intros A B C C' [HAB [HCA HCB]] [HA1 HC1] [HB1 HC2].
  (* From the definitions, Cong A C A C' -> A = A and C = C', so HC1 : C = C' *)
  assumption.
